Hermanin de Reichenfeld, G., Fog, B. V., (2025) _The Orige.net Project: Digital Exploration of Biblical Quotations in Origen of Alexandria's Exegesis_. [https://ghdr90.github.io/orige-networks/](https://ghdr90.github.io/orige-networks/about).

## Description of the Project
_Orige.net_ is an open-access digital platform that applies Network Analysis to biblical quotations and theological concepts within the works of Origen of Alexandria. Conceived and designed by Dr. [Giovanni Hermanin de Reichenfeld](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/giovanni.hermanin%40cas.au.dk/publications/) as part of his Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship (grant no. 101149891 – Orige.net), the project builds a searchable graph database connecting two types of nodes: 

-	passages from Origen’s works, shown in blue (e.g., Princ. 1.1.1)
-	referenced biblical quotations, shown in yellow (e.g., John 1:1).

The application allows users to filter and connect biblical quotations (e.g., John 1:1), Origen’s writings (e.g., De Principiis), and doctrinal themes (e.g., Trinity, Soul). The core search and filter functionality includes free-text search, work-based filtering, doctrine filtering, and referenced-work filtering.
Through _Orige.net_, users can:

- Explore how Origen uses Scripture to explain specific doctrines across his works
- Visualise intersections between theology and exegesis in Origen's thought
- Identify all biblical texts cited in relation to one or more doctrines across Origen’s works
- Identify Origen’s quotations of one or more biblical texts used to explain particular theological doctrines
- Compare Origen’s biblical usage across doctrines or works

The aim of the project is to allow scholars to reconstruct Origen’s "textual mind" – the mental network through which he engaged with Scripture – thus offering the scholarly community a powerful tool for visualising and analysing interpretive patterns previously inaccessible without computational support. Orige.net represents a significant methodological advance in textual studies and invites scholars to apply similar tools to other ancient authors and traditions.

All data have been manually collected and revised by Dr. [Giovanni Hermanin de Reichenfeld](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/giovanni.hermanin%40cas.au.dk/publications/) and structured in a JSON format. Data collection involved reading all of Origen’s works and manually assigning specific doctrines and biblical quotations to each passage. Grounded in rigorous scholarly practice, this process inevitably reflects a degree of interpretation, as the identification and categorisation of doctrinal elements require informed hermeneutic judgment which embraces the interpretive framework of the scholar who undertakes it.

The platform employs [_sigma.js_](https://sigmajs.org/) and [_graphology_](https://graphology.github.io/) to render interactive network graphs in the browser, enabling users to analyse centrality, proximity, and connections between scriptural and theological nodes. The website and codes are developed by [Bjarke Vognstrup Fog](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/bfog@cc.au.dk) at the [Center for Humanities Computing](https://chc.au.dk), Aarhus University. Please refer to the [How to use the database](https://ghdr90.github.io/orige-networks/how-to-use) page for further instructions and tutorials.

## Download the Full Dataset
The web app requires a JSON file containing all entries that are modelled in the graph. The JSON file with all the entries can be downloaded at the following link:

Please note that the data collection is still in progress and therefore the files will be implemented continuously.
